and now leadership candidate - Paul Nuttall said he would \"let bygones be bygones\", and that the party had to \"forgive but not forget\".\\n\"Let\\'s stop knocking lumps out of each other,\" he urged, vowing to publish proposals for constitutional reform of the party to \"tighten everything up\".\\nFellow candidate Suzanne Evans also called for changes to the party machinery, saying the ruling National Executive Committee had to be reformed and be made more open and accountable.\\n\"Our members are sick of this,\" added the former deputy chairwoman, who was unable to take part in the previous contest because of her suspension from the party.\\n\"Let\\'s focus our fight on the real enemy.\"\\nBusinessman John Rees-Evans offered the most radical reform to party structure - an online balloting system that would see UKIP\\'s policies set by its membership.\\nUnlike the more upbeat assessment of his rivals, Mr Rees-Evans provided a pessimistic outlook on the party\\'s current predicament, saying it was in a \"crisis\", short of funds and with a declining membership.\\nCulture spokesman and London Assembly member Peter Whittle called for \"some form of collective responsibility\" from the party.\\n\"We\\'ve got to be singing from the same hymn sheet when we go out into the public,\" he added.\\nCandidates also set out their policy priorities, and aside from Brexit - where they all agreed on taking the fastest route out of the European Union - immigration, combating Islamic extremism and curbing the rise of Sharia courts were common themes.\\nThere were no questions on the death penalty, which divided the panel at an earlier LBC debate.\\nMr Nuttall vowed to replace Labour as the \"patriotic voice of the working class\", while Ms Evans said it had to broaden its appeal to more women and ethnic minority voters, vowing to put more \"kippers\" in schools and teaching unions to ensure pupils are taught \"to be proud of Britain\".\\nMr Whittle said every school should display the union jack and a picture of the Queen.\\nMr Rees-Evans said he would aim to increase the party membership to 500,000, warning that the other candidates would continue UKIP\\'s \"current demise\".\\nThat was as close as we got to criticism of a fellow panellist - and there was no sign of dissent in the audience, who applauded each candidate after every question, with Mr Nuttall getting a standing ovation from some sections.\\nIt was left to Mr Oakden to close proceedings, with a nod to ex-UKIP MEP Steven Woolfe\\'s parting attack on the state of the party.\\n\"I think anyone who thinks the party is in a \\'death spiral\\' should have been here tonight,\" he said.\\nUKIP\\'s new leader will be announced on 28 November, with the deadline for ballots to be returned on 25 November.', 'The charity\\'s jousting expert Dominic Sewell told BBC\\'s Radio 5 live that the medieval pursuit was a \"worldwide phenomenon that should be recognised\".\\nOnly about 20 people in the UK joust competitively, but the charity said tournaments were held across the world.\\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it was \"unaware\" of any official request for its recognition.\\nFor a sport to be included in the Olympic Games programme, it must be governed by an international federation, practised widely across the world, and meet other various criteria before being considered by the IOC\\'s executive board.\\nEnglish Heritage said it had made an initial approach to the IOC and the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) - which governs all Olympic equestrian disciplines - as a first step on jousting\\'s road to the Olympics.\\nJousting would need to be recognised by the FEI before it could be considered as an Olympic sport by the IOC, English Heritage said.\\nMr Sewell, who jousts competitively, said: \"Just like the Olympic British equestrian team, we ride beautiful horses to an exceptional level.\"\\nHe said jousting required a \"huge amount of skill and a daily training regime\", adding one had to be \"strong, not just physically but mentally, so you can sit fearlessly in your saddle, face your rival, and offer yourself as a target\".\\nMr Sewell, a former furniture assembler in a factory, said: \"This has gone from being a hobby to being a sport and a career.\"\\nHe told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme his interest had originally been fuelled by visiting historical re-enactments, but added: \"I\\'m a sportsman, I\\'m not an actor.\"\\nMr Sewell went on: \"As soon as I got on a horse everything changed and I thought: this is what I want to do, I want to be good at this.\"\\nEnglish Heritage admitted it could be a \"long road\" to get jousting recognised as an Olympic sport, but said there were \"encouraging signs\".\\nTournaments were growing in popularity, the charity said, and were now held in countries such as Belgium, Brazil and New Zealand.\\nIn the US, where jousting has been the official state sport of Maryland since 1962, competitors have launched a similar Olympic campaign.\\nJousting today is \"quite a safe sport to take part in\", Mr Sewell says.\\n\"The rules are essentially that you are in a single combat situation, in a designated area, in a pitch - or \\'tilt-yard\\' - and in that yard is a tilt rail.\"\\nThe competitors charge down the rail towards each other with points awarded on the style and strength of their hit.\\nWearing a suit of armour weighing around 20kg, the athletes hold a 12ft lance in one hand and their horse\\'s reins in the other, all while riding towards their opponents at a flat-out gallop - at speeds of up to 30mph.\\n\"These days injuries are few and far between... but the odd un-horsing might result in a few bruises,\" Mr Sewell says.\\nThe IOC said its programme was currently being addressed as part of the Olympic Agenda 2020, the group\\'s strategy for the future of the Olympics.\\nA spokesman said: \"One recommendation was to make the Olympic programme more flexible by moving from a sport-based to an event-based programme.\"\\nEarlier this month, the IOC supported a bid to add karate, skateboarding, sports climbing, surfing and baseball/softball to the programme for Tokyo 2020.\\nIf approved, the inclusion would add 18 events and 474 athletes to the Olympic Games.\\nJousting, with its roots in Ancient Greece, where it was practised as part of preparations for war, emerged in England in the 10th Century as a sport for knights to hone their equine and lance skills.\\nThe first jousting tournament in England is said to have been arranged by the Frenchman Godfrey de Preuilly in 1066.\\nThe tournaments became so popular that in the 12th Century, King Henry II banned the sport, as he considered it too dangerous to have a number of highly skilled knights in the same place at the same time.\\nThe ban was lifted under King Richard I and the sport remained popular, particularly during the Tudor era, until declining after the French King Henry I was killed during a joust in 1559.\\nJousting enjoyed a revival under 19th Century romanticism, with writers such Lord Byron, Percy Shelley and Sir Walter Scott glamorising notions of chivalry with tales of knights and fair maidens.', 'The incident happened in Lime Grove, in the Craigshill area of Livingston, at about 21:30 on Wednesday.\\nThe thief got into the white Peugeot 208 but was unable to drive off because the passenger had managed to remove the keys from the ignition before running off.\\nThe thief then chased the passenger in a bid to take the keys from him.\\nAfter failing to get the keys, the suspect returned to the car and tried to push it away, before eventually giving up.\\nHe was last seen heading in the direction of Craigshill East Road.\\nPolice are appealing for witnesses.\\nThe man was white, aged about 19 and was about 5ft 6in tall.\\nHe was wearing a grey hooded tracksuit with the hood up, partially covering his face, grey tracksuit bottoms and dark-coloured Adidas trainers.\\nDet Con Iain Duncan, of Police Scotland, said: \"Although the victim was not seriously injured the brazen nature of this crime is quite remarkable.\\n\"We are pursuing various lines of inquiry including a review of the local CCTV network and carrying out door-to-door inquiries.\\n\"However, I\\'m now appealing to anyone in the local community who can help identify the suspect to come forward.\\n\"I\\'d also be interested to hear from anyone who was in the Craigshill area of Livingston on Wednesday night and who noticed any suspicious behaviour.\"']\n",

It was published north of the border as the injunction did not apply outside England and Wales.\\nAs Scotland is a separate legal jurisdiction, foreign judgments, including those from England and Wales, require to be registered in Scotland to work.\\nHowever, a foreign judgment can only be registered in Scotland if it is a final order of the court.\\nInterim orders are issued during the course of an action for protective purposes until the court has the opportunity of hearing the case and making a final order.\\nThe gagging order obtained by the celebrity was an interim injunction. It was not a final judgment and so could not be enforced in Scotland.\\nIf the celebtrity had wanted to obtain protection in Scotland, the celebrity would have needed to go to the Scottish court seeking interim interdict (the Scottish term for an interim injunction). This could be done in two ways:\\nThere is little practical difference between the two approaches.\\nIf an interim interdict had been granted under either of those two options then it would have stopped the printed publication in Scotland and the Court of Appeal might have come to a different decision.\\nSo, what's going to happen now? On Monday the court gave the man time to apply to take his case to the UK Supreme Court.\\nIn the ruling, they said there must be no publication leading to disclosure of the celebrity's identity before 13:00 BST on Wednesday.\\nThe celebrity - who has young children and whose spouse is also well-known - has until 10:00 BST on Tuesday to submit arguments to the Supreme Court.\\nIt will then decide whether to hear the case - and therefore extend the reporting ban - or to throw it out, leading to the order being being lifted.\"]\n",

At his trial, he admitted to having sex with the woman but denied rape.\\nEvans was released from prison in October after serving half of his sentence.

      "input_texts: ['The two sides are meeting for the first time in nearly three years to negotiate an end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict based on the two-state solution formula.\\nWho is taking part in the negotiations?\\nIn Jerusalem, the Palestinians will be represented by senior negotiator Saeb Erekat and senior Fatah official Muhammed Shtayyeh. Israeli Minister of Justice Tzipi Livni and prime ministerial aide Isaac Molcho will represent the Israeli side.\\nUS Middle East Peace Envoy Martin Indyk and his deputy, Frank Lowenstein, have been named as envoys to the meeting.\\nSince his appointment in February, US Secretary of State John Kerry has invested much political capital and time in convincing the two sides to resume talks.\\nWhat has happened so far?\\nThe two sides met with US mediators on 29 and 30 July in Washington to officially launch the peace talks.\\nThis came after Mr Kerry got the parties to agree to resume negotiations. The terms of the deal he hammered out have not been disclosed.\\nBut as part of the process, Israel has agreed to release 104 long-serving Palestinian prisoners. This began with 26 in the early hours of 14 August.\\nThe Palestinians, for their part, are expected to refrain from upgrading their membership of UN agencies.\\nThe resumption of talks was preceded by the Israeli government\\'s announcement of the construction of some 2,000 new settler homes in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\\nThe Palestinians voiced dismay but Mr Kerry said the move was \"not unexpected\".\\nIsraeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.\\nWhat are they talking about?\\nMr Kerry said in late July that all final-status issues - Jerusalem, borders, security arrangements, settlements and Palestinian refugees - would be on the table.\\nHe did not specify a timetable and added that both sides had agreed to keep the contents of meetings confidential.\\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an April meeting with Mr Kerry that Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state would be among the first issues.\\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told reporters in Cairo in July that the talks would focus first on borders and security.\\nWhat\\'s the timeframe for the peace process?\\nThe US has announced that final-status talks will be held for nine months. Officials on the two sides have indicated their agreement to this.\\nAfter the initial Jerusalem talks, the parties will meet later in Jericho in the West Bank, although a date for this round has not yet been set.\\nWhy is it so hard to reach agreement?\\nThe negotiations will resume amid challenging circumstances for both sides.\\nThe Palestinians are divided politically between the West Bank-based Fatah and Islamist Hamas movement, which has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, and has condemned the talks.\\nSome other Palestinian groups, such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), staged protests against the talks.\\nMr Netanyahu also faces internal challenges. Despite the public support for peace talks, some of his coalition partners - for example the Jewish Home party - and members of his own Likud party oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state.\\nMore importantly, the two sides appear to have wide gaps separating their optimal positions. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of their state, an idea that is vehemently opposed by some parties in the Israeli cabinet, who maintain Jerusalem should be the undivided capital of Israel.\\nMr Netanyahu\\'s government is likely to insist on keeping some Israeli settlements in the West Bank or East Jerusalem as part of a final deal. Previous talks have suggested mutually-agreed land swaps with the Palestinians as a way to achieve this.\\nWhat has been agreed in previous deals?\\nThe 1993 Oslo accords ushered in a new era with the formation of the Palestinian Authority as an interim body and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\\nBut the assassination of former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 put the process on hold. Subsequent Israeli governments carried out more territorial withdrawals and signed further economic agreements, but without ending the conflict..\\nIn September 2008, the two sides appeared to be close to signing a final peace deal during talks between former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Mr Abbas. However, this round ended fruitlessly after Mr Olmert\\'s resignation over corruption charges and the alleged refusal by Mr Abbas to accept the Israeli offer.\\nWhat is at stake for the rest of the region?\\nThe Palestinian-Israeli conflict has long been seen as a driver of negative sentiment towards Israel in the Middle East and the wider Muslim world.\\nBut the talks are resuming against the backdrop of regional upheavals after the Arab Spring. Since 2011, many neighbouring Arab countries, especially Egypt and Syria, have been in turmoil.\\nAt stake is also the legacy of the Obama administration, and its push for better ties with the Muslim world.\\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

As a result, an independent panel - the Accountability Review Board- was charged with investigating the incident.\\nThe report identified the state department\\'s Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near East Affairs for criticism over their apparent lack of cooperation and ensuing confusion with regards to protection.\\n\"Systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels within two bureaus of the State Department resulted in a Special Mission security posture that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place,\" the panel concluded.\\nHowever, the review has not suggested disciplinary action be taken against any individuals.\\nDespite \"a lack of transparency, responsiveness, and leadership\" among certain senior state department officials, the report found no \"reasonable cause\" that any specific individuals had \"engaged in misconduct or wilfully ignored\" their responsibilities.\\nIt also said there had been \"no immediate, specific\" intelligence about the 11 September attack or threats to the consulate.\\nIn a letter to congressional committees, Mrs Clinton said she had ordered the state department to implement the investigation\\'s findings \"quickly and completely\".\\nShe outlined some steps the agency would take, including sending hundreds of Marine guards to US missions abroad and assigning a state department official to oversee \"high threat posts\".\\nIn addition, Mrs Clinton said the state department would request more funding from Congress to make improvements to security.\\nThe probe concluded that the US personnel had \"performed with courage and readiness to risk their lives to protect their colleagues in a near-impossible situation\".\\nBut the Benghazi mission had nevertheless been hampered by a lack of resources. The reliance on armed \"but poorly skilled\" local militiamen and contract guards was \"misplaced,\" the report said.\\n\"The solution requires a more serious and sustained commitment from Congress to support State Department needs which constitute a small percentage of the full national budget and that spent for national security,\" according to the review.\\nThe probe also criticised the Libyan government\\'s response to the attack, characterising it as \"profoundly lacking\".\\nThe Obama administration\\'s handling of the attack in Benghazi has become the focus of Republican criticism.\\nOfficials initially said the attack had developed out of protests against an anti-Muslim video.\\nBut later intelligence reports suggested it was possibly tied to al-Qaeda affiliates.', 'It marks the first phase of Plasdwr, a 900-acre site bordering Fairwater, St Fagans, Danescourt and Radyr.\\nWork is expected to start to the north and south of Llantrisant Road in the summer and the first residents are expected to move in by spring 2017.\\nConstruction of the first phase of the garden city will generate between 2,000 and 3,000 jobs, Redrow Homes said.\\nThe developers said Plasdwr would include shops, schools, leisure centres, pubs and restaurants.', 'The team uncovered the signature of a planet that had been \"eaten\" by looking at the chemistry of the host star.\\nThey also think a surviving planet around this star may have been kicked into its unusual orbit by the destruction of a neighbouring world.\\nDetails of the work have been published in Astrophysical Journal Letters.\\nThe US-Polish-Spanish team made the discovery when they were studying the star BD+48 740 - which is one of a stellar class known as red giants. Their observations were made with the Hobby Eberly telescope, based at the McDonald Observatory in Texas.\\nRising temperatures near the cores of red giants cause these elderly stars to expand in size, a process which will cause any nearby planets to be destroyed.\\n\"A similar fate may await the inner planets in our solar system, when the Sun becomes a red giant and expands all the way out to Earth\\'s orbit some five billion years from now,\" said co-author Prof Alexander Wolszczan from Pennsylvania State University in the US.\\nThe first piece of evidence for the missing planet comes from the star\\'s peculiar chemical composition.\\nSpectroscopic analysis of BD+48 740 revealed that it contained an abnormally high amount of lithium, a rare element created primarily during the Big Bang 14 billion years ago.\\nLithium is easily destroyed in stars, so its high abundance in this ageing star is very unusual.\\n\"Theorists have identified only a few, very specific circumstances, other than the Big Bang, under which lithium can be created in stars,\" Prof Wolszczan explained.\\n\"In the case of BD+48 740, it is probable that the lithium production was triggered by a mass the size of a planet that spiralled into the star and heated it up while the star was digesting it.\"\\nThe second piece of evidence discovered by the astronomers is the highly elliptical orbit of a newly discovered planet around the red giant star. The previously undetected world is at least 1.6 times as massive as Jupiter.\\nCo-author Andrzej Niedzielski of Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland, said that orbits as eccentric as this one are uncommon in planetary systems around evolved stars.\\n\"In fact, the BD+48 740 planet\\'s orbit is the most elliptical one detected so far,\" he added.\\nBecause gravitational interactions between planets are often responsible for such peculiar orbits, the astronomers suspect that the dive of the missing planet toward its host star before it became a giant could have given the surviving massive planet a burst of energy.\\nThis boost would have propelled it into its present unusual orbit.\\nTeam member Eva Villaver of the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid in Spain commented: \"Catching a planet in the act of being devoured by a star is an almost improbable feat to accomplish because of the comparative swiftness of the process, but the occurrence of such a collision can be deduced from the way it affects the stellar chemistry.\\n\"The highly elongated orbit of the massive planet we discovered around this lithium-polluted red giant star is exactly the kind of evidence that would point to the star\\'s recent destruction of its now-missing planet.\"']\n",

      "input_texts: ['The plans for Anfield, which are subject to a public consultation, would see Liverpool FC\\'s stadium expanded and new housing and a business hub built.\\nThe plan would also see the creation of a wide avenue through Stanley Park, which would end in a new public square.\\nA spokesman for Liverpool City Council said the completed buildings could create up to 700 jobs in the area.\\nMayor Joe Anderson said the regeneration would help an area of the city which had \"been in the doldrums for a long time\".\\nThe north Liverpool area has been the subject of proposed regeneration in the past and Mr Anderson said the time residents had had to wait for plans to come to fruition represented a \"shameful period for the city\".\\n\"Too many false dawns have happened and I hope people take comfort from the fact we are seeing tangible results of a determination to make things happen,\" he said.\\n\"We\\'ve got to continue that work to make sure the area is regenerated in terms not just of infrastructure but of people as well, making sure it\\'s vibrant again and that people want to live here.\"\\nThe Anfield area has already seen the restoration of Stanley Park, the building of new housing and refurbishment of existing homes, and the construction of a new primary school and health centre.\\nThe new plans will see the building of 250 new homes, the creation of the park avenue and square, and the construction of a 100-bed hotel.\\nHe added that 296 properties in the area would be removed to make way for the new developments.\\nThe plan comes after Liverpool FC\\'s announcement in October that it would be adding around 15,000 seats to its existing stadium rather than building a new arena in Stanley Park.\\nThe club\\'s managing director Ian Ayre said the \"unveiling of this vision for the wider regeneration of Anfield is another important step towards transforming the area for the better\".', 'Alongside tents and drinking water, RAF planes dropped more than 1,000 solar-powered lanterns attached to chargers for all types of mobile handsets to the stranded members of the Yazidi religious community below.\\nIt is the first time the lanterns have been airdropped in such a relief effort, but humanitarian workers say it is part of growing efforts to develop technology designed to make a difference in disaster zones.\\nIn 2010, Dr Paul Gardner-Stephen, a computer systems researcher at Flinders University in Australia, was driving to work in his car when he first heard radio reports of the devastation of the Haiti earthquake, more than 10,000 miles away.\\nWith roads blocked, infrastructure reduced to rubble and mobile networks down, he realised something needed to be done, and quickly.\\n\"You typically have about three days to restore the communications before the bad people realise the good people aren\\'t in control any more,\" he says.\\nHis solution was to develop the technology that allows mobile phones to communicate directly with each other even where there is no network coverage, or when mobile masts have been knocked out of action - a system known as \"mesh networking\".\\nHis Serval Project work means users can send text messages, make calls and send files to other users nearby, creating a mobile network through a web of users.\\nIt is just one example of the dozens of technologies developed in the wake of Haiti to help relief efforts in disaster zones.\\n\"There\\'s plenty of technology for rich white men,\" Dr Gardner-Stephen says. \"It\\'s the rest of the world that we need to help.\"\\nAnother project born out of the Haiti disaster was the Trilogy Emergency Relief Application (Tera), a mass text messaging programme now being rolled out by the Red Cross in 40 countries around the world.\\nIt allows aid workers to navigate a disaster-hit country from a computer screen, identify all the mobile phones being used in a given area, and blast them all with urgent 140-character updates with a click of a button.\\nIt was first developed in Haiti with the help of local mobile network operators, allowing messages with advice on water sanitation and medical aid to be distributed to millions of people across the Caribbean country.\\n\"I don\\'t know of any other means of communication where you could reach that many people, that quickly and that directly,\" says Sharon Reader, a communications adviser for the International Red Cross currently working on setting up the Tera system in east Africa.\\n\"It\\'s not like the radio when someone has to be switched on and listening. It\\'s a buzz in their pocket and they\\'re going to be able to see that information immediately.\"\\nShe says the sheer volume of mobile phones now sold in developing countries makes text messaging the ideal way to communicate.\\nGlobal mobile subscriptions are expected to reach seven billion this year according to the UN, with developing countries in Africa and Asia seeing the fastest growth.\\nThe Tera project also allows disaster victims to send messages back to aid agencies, telling them where they are and what they most urgently need.\\nThat makes it similar to other recently developed applications designed to harvest the huge volumes of information generated in the immediate aftermath of a sudden-onset disaster, like a war or earthquake.\\nThe Ushahidi project was used in Haiti to crowd source information from the Haitain population, using social media sources like Twitter and Facebook alongside text messages, with information visualised on an online map for humanitarian agencies to use.\\nSimilar platforms became popular following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.\\nThe Japanese are the third biggest users of Twitter in the world, and the network became a crucial communication method and information source, typically faster and more effective than mainstream media.\\nSeveral similar projects are being developed, including those through the Digital Humanitarian Network and the Standby Taskforce - organisations that mobilise volunteers with expertise in monitoring social media, translating messages to and from local dialects, and creating crisis maps around disasters.\\nKim Scriven is the manager of the Humanitarian Innovation Fund, a government-backed agency set up in 2011 that supports innovative research in humanitarian aid.\\nHe says the trying to harvest and filter the vast amounts of data generated by a disaster or conflict is \"the big nut that people are trying to crack\", with the real challenge being to turn all of that data into information that humanitarian agencies can actually act on.\\n\"There are lots of people working on it, but in my view that hasn\\'t happened yet,\" he says.\\nAlongside the smaller start-ups typically supported by Mr Scriven\\'s fund, the bigger technology players are beginning to show more interest in humanitarian applications for their technology.\\nGoogle recently unveiled its drone programme, which it suggests could be used to airdrop aid into disaster zones.\\nLast year, the search giant unveiled Project Loon - a plan to deliver internet connections to hard-to-reach places through a network of high-altitude balloons.\\nBoth are in the early stages of development. But aid workers say we are seeing a sea-change in the role of technology in humanitarian relief, and how it can empower those affected by the disaster they find themselves in.\\n\"[Disaster relief] is no longer about just dropping items on people and leaving them to it,\" says the Red Cross\\'s Sharon Reader.\\n\"There has been a huge shift in the aid world in seeing people who are affected by a crisis not as victims but as people who have the capacity to look after themselves.\"', \"The visitors' coach was at a standstill for over two hours, meaning the players got changed during the journey.\\nThe action was worth the wait as John Rooney swept Chester ahead before Scott Doe bundled in an equaliser.\\nRooney put Chester back in front with a curling free-kick, but Harry White restored parity in a late scramble.\", 'Media playback is not supported on this device\\n\"It\\'s good to be upset at losing,\" says the former Southampton and Coventry manager.\\n\"Because then you do something about it.\"']\n",

By expanding in this direction, rather than becoming a more interesting social meeting service, it could be perceived as an orgy app.\"\\nTinder\\'s chief executive Sean Rad, however, stressed that it was not about targeting this \"niche\" activity.\\n\"It definitely allows you to make connections beyond just romantic ones,\" he explained.\\n\"We look at Tinder as not just being a dating app, but capturing your entire social life. And your social life has so many different aspects to it.\\n\"The beauty of putting this in the same app is that we have scale - we have tens of millions of users all over the world.\\n\"So, overnight you can get the power of Tinder and connect with others going out tonight in a way that was never possible.\"\\nTinder is owned by InterActiveCorp (IAC), a New York-based business that also owns the dating site Match.com, the search service Ask, and The Daily Beast news site.\\nIt says that 85% of Tinder\\'s users are between the ages of 18 to 34, and that the app has already led to more than 11 billion matches since it launched in 2012.\\nAn earlier version of Tinder Social was tested earlier this year in Australia. It is now being rolled out in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and India.\\nTo use it, users must first opt in to the feature within the existing app.\\nThen they need to:\\nUsers can then see other groups. If a member from both sides \"swipes right\" to pick the other, members can then make the necessary arrangements via a group chat feature.\\nAs a security measure, users may leave a group at any time. Furthermore, the next day, the group chat expires, and individual members need to like each other to stay in contact, assuming they have not already swapped other contact details.\\nFor the moment, Tinder Social is completely free to use.\\nBut Mr Rad suggested his firm could make money by adding premium features, which users would need to have a Tinder Plus account to access.\\nTinder Plus currently costs Â£3.99 for under-28s and Â£14.99 for older users, allowing them to look at members they had initially rejected and see people who live in other parts of the world.\\n\"Over the coming months we will clarify the relationship between the two products,\" Mr Rad said.\\n\"But it\\'s not different from Snapchat having multiple products within the same app. They sort of mingle, but you can really use them separately.\"']\n",

      "input_texts: [\"The case follows secret filming by the BBC's Panorama TV programme at the Castlebeck-owned Winterbourne View hospital near Hambrook.\\nWayne Rogers, 31, and Allison Dove, 24, both of Kingswood, admitted to nine and seven charges each and Holly Draper, 23, pleaded guilty to two charges.\\nThe programme showed patients allegedly being physically and verbally abused.\\nBoth Rogers and Dove pleaded not guilty to one charge each under the Mental Capacity Act, which was accepted by the Crown with the charges resting on file.\\nThe court heard the offences were committed between February and March 2011.\\nJudge Michael Longman released all three on bail to await sentencing at a later date.\\nAt the same hearing, Michael Ezenagu, 28, of Malabar Court, India Way, London, pleaded not guilty to three counts of ill-treatment.\\nNeil Ferguson, 27, of Emersons Green, Bristol, pleaded not guilty to one count of ill-treatment.\\nNo pleas were entered by Graham Doyle, 25, from Patchway, Jason Gardiner, 42, of Bristol, Charlotte Cotterell, 21, from Yate, Kelvin Fore, 33, of Middlesbrough, Sookalingum Appoo, 58, of Bristol and Danny Brake, 27 of Bristol.\\nThey will have their cases dealt with on 16 March.\\nTwenty-four patients were transferred from Winterbourne View following the investigation and the home was closed last June.\\nA spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said a further three people who were arrested during the investigation will not face charges.\", 'Marc Traylor, 42, of Hersden, near Canterbury, stabbed his 16-year-old daughter with two kitchen knives.\\nJurors heard Mr Traylor, who had paranoid schizophrenia, had stopped taking his medication after being allowed to self-medicate.\\nHe had denied the charge at Canterbury Crown Court.\\nDuring the trial, a firearms officer told the court Mr Traylor\\'s daughter had been in \"imminent danger\" on the day of the attack on 9 February.\\nHe told jurors he saw Mr Traylor stab the girl several times and she was screaming with the blows.\\nThe officer said he realised her life was in danger and shot Mr Traylor three times.\\nMr Traylor was shot once in the chest and twice in the head by officers.\\nKent Police said Mr Traylor was incapacitated by the third shot.\\nOne officer had already fired a Taser which missed and the officer who fired the bullets also fired his Taser first but it too missed, the court heard.\\nBoth Mr Traylor and his daughter, who has since recovered, were taken to hospital after the attack.\\nHe remains in hospital where he needs help to eat, drink and walk.\\nThe court heard Mr Traylor had twice been detained under the Mental Health Act.\\nAfter the hearing, Det Ch Insp Nick Gossett said he hoped the verdict would bring \"some closure to all parties involved\".\\nHe added: \"Equally, Mr Traylor will be able to get the medical support that he needs at a secure hospital.\"\\nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which investigated the incident, said Kent Police\\'s use of force, including the discharge of a hand gun and Tasers, was proportionate given the threat to life.\\n\"Negotiations and risk assessments conducted by officers were appropriate,\" an IPCC spokesman added.\\nHe said IPCC recommendations, which have been accepted by Kent Police, included the force should consider modifying Taser training to incorporate scenarios with third parties, complete work to draft and approve its policy on negotiations, and review training to ensure effective information sharing by front line and armed officers at incidents.\\nFollowing the court case, Mr Traylor\\'s defence solicitor Sean Caulfield said the families of people with paranoid schizophrenia needed support and access to help, and those with the condition needed regular checks.\\n\"Sadly, the Traylor family has suffered the life-changing consequences of a lapse in this care and Mr Traylor may now have to live in a supported unit for the rest of his life due to events of that night,\" he said.\\nHe said Mr Traylor had the support of his family who understood he could not be held responsible for his actions.\\nKent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust said patients wished to have as fully independent lives as possible and part of their rehabilitation included self-administering medication.\\nIn a statement, the NHS said it worked closely with patients to reach a point where this was possible and this included a thorough risk assessment process.', 'It is thought the actress will make her last appearance as Clara Oswald before the Christmas special, which sees the return of Alex Kingston as River Song.\\nColeman joined Doctor Who in 2012, and has starred alongside two Doctors, Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi.\\nThe Mirror reports that her next role will be as Queen Victoria in a major ITV drama series.\\nThe 29-year-old, who began her career in the soap opera Emmerdale, is expected to play the Queen from the age of 18 and in the early years of her reign.\\nHowever, ITV said it was not making \"any announcements about casting presently\".\\nThe BBC has also declined to confirm Coleman\\'s departure from Doctor Who.\\nIn an interview published in the Radio Times this week, the actress said she had always known her time on the show was finite.\\n\"You\\'re in Doctor Who knowing it will never last,\" she said.\\n\"It\\'s constantly regenerating, so you want to make your time count and enjoy the adventure for the fleeting time you\\'re here.\"\\nITV announced in May they would be making an eight-part series about the life of Queen Victoria.\\nIt is being made by the producers of Poldark and has been created and written by the novelist Daisy Goodwin.\\nFilming starts this month and it is understood that Coleman has already filmed her final scenes for Doctor Who, which returns to BBC One on Saturday.\\nRumours of the star\\'s departure circulated last year, after a cliffhanger in the series eight finale, Death In Heaven.\\nFans had to wait until the end of the Christmas Day special to find out whether Coleman\\'s character would return.\\nChief writer Steven Moffat later confirmed the actress had initially asked to be written out of the drama.\\n\"That was her last episode,\" he said. \"Then she asked me if she could be in [the] Christmas [episode]. So I said, \\'OK, I\\'ll write you out in Christmas.\\'\"\\n\"She came to the read through and did the \\'write out\\' version - and again changed her mind.\"\\n\"But the truth is I never wanted her to go. And with Last Christmas, I\\'d already written the alternative version where she stayed, and I preferred that version.\\n\"Frankly, I didn\\'t want to lose her. She\\'s an amazing actress, and she never stops working to make Clara better. I was very happy to go the extra mile to make sure we could keep her.\"\\nCapaldi, who plays the current incarnation of the Doctor, said he was \"thrilled\" Coleman had signed up for another series.\\nWhile the actress said it was \"wonderful\" to stay, adding she \"couldn\\'t walk away with the story being unresolved.\"', '300 fire fighters tackled the blaze and more than 1,400 people had to be evacuated from their homes.\\nThe fire took hold on Sunday, not far from the popular tourist resort of Benidorm.\\nThe Spanish police think some of the fires might have been started on purpose.\\nThe wildfire has destroyed around 790 acres of land and several buildings, local emergency services said.\\nMany people affected by the fire were evacuated to schools to spend the night.\\nResidents living nearby also offered those who had been moved places to stay and gave them food and water.']\n",

Institution (RNLI) in Bangor, County Down, knew Capt Fitzpatrick through their rescue work, and they met the Queen together.\\n\"I had the privilege of meeting Dara for the first time in 2009 when she visited Bangor - it was a royal visit at the time and she was representing the Irish Coast Guard,\" he said.\\n\"She had also landed her helicopter here a number of times to visit the station.\\n\"I found Dara very dedicated to her job and extremely professional.\"\\nThe Irish navy, the RNLI, police divers and fishing boats are searching the coast off Mayo for the three missing crew members and the helicopter\\'s flight recorder.\\nCapt Fitzpatrick had been found in a critical condition by an RNLI crew hours after the crash.\\nMr Johnston said that although the RNLI is not part of the coastguard, the two services \"work and train very close together\".\\n\"We have a very symbiotic relationship - Her Majesty\\'s Coastguard in the north [of Ireland], the Irish Coast Guard in the south and the RNLI is just one big team when it comes to rescuing people at sea,\" he added.\\n\"We really feel this has affected everybody, so the whole of the RNLI in Ireland is flying flags at half-mast.\"\\nThat, he said, was a symbol of \"unity and togetherness\".\\n\"Any time a crew goes out on a rescue mission they really have no idea what they\\'re going to face,\" he added.\\n\"That\\'s what crews do, and they they have to be trained and prepared for anything.\\n\"It\\'s just shocking that they\\'ve been putting their lives at risk to save the crewman on a fishing boat.\"', 'People who attended a christening at the same venue the following day have also been reporting feeling sick and having diarrhoea.\\nPublic Health England (PHE) said it is likely to be

regular updates on Facebook.\\nHedex, one of the DJ\\'s at the event, said on Twitter on Monday: \"I am so ill I am considering to start writing my will.\"\\nDr Sarah Harrison, consultant in health protection for PHE South West, said: \"Norovirus is highly infectious.\\n\"PHE is working with environmental health officers from the council to ensure that appropriate precautions and procedures are in place.\"\\nThe latest advice from PHE is that anyone with suspected norovirus should drink plenty of water and avoid preparing food for, or direct contact with, others until 48 hours after the symptoms have stopped.', 'Paediatric care at Northallerton\\'s Friarage Hospital could be moved to James Cook University Hospital, 22 miles (35km) away, in Middlesbrough.\\nProtesters marched to the

think people from outside the area don\\'t realise the distances involved.\\n\"Without this hospital those who live at the top of Wensleydale would have a round trip of over 100 miles to Middlesbrough

the unit  \\n          was not sustainable.\\nIt said the hospital provided a first-class service but in relation to paediatric services it expressed concerns about the hospital being able to maintain a workforce with the right skills.\\nIt also said if children needed inpatient care they should be cared for in a unit which has a full range of services backed up by high dependency and intensive care facilities.\\nA scaling-back of maternity services was also included in the report\\'s recommendations.\\nThe NCAT report is being considered by the South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust,

I saw three men on the ground, literally 10 feet from the road.\"\\nAlthough Pontyclun Van Hire is near the spot where the men were arrested, police said the incident was not connected to the Finsbury Park mosque attack in London.\\nA van hired from the company was used in Monday\\'s attack.\\n\"There are absolutely no links at this stage,\" said a spokesman.', 'The computing giant said software vulnerabilities hoarded by governments had caused \"widespread damage\".\\nThe latest virus exploits a flaw in a version of Microsoft Windows first identified by US intelligence.\\nThere are fears of further \"ransomware\" attacks as people return to work on Monday.\\nMany firms have had experts working over the weekend to prevent new infections. The virus took control of users\\' files and demanded $300 (Â£230) payments to restore access.\\nThe spread of the virus slowed over the weekend but the respite might only be brief, experts have warned. More than 200,000 computers have been affected so far.\\nA statement from Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith on Sunday criticised the way governments store up information about security flaws in computer systems.\\n\"We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world,\" he wrote.\\n\"An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen.\"\\nHe added: \"The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call.\"\\nMicrosoft said it had released a Windows security update in March to tackle the problem involved in the latest attack, but many users were yet to run it.\\n\"As cybercriminals become more sophisticated, there is simply no way for customers to protect themselves against threats unless they update their systems,\" Mr Smith said.\\nThere are going to be some tough questions on Monday for those institutions which didn\\'t do enough to keep their networks secure, as well as the organisations that were best placed to stop it happening in the first place - the NSA and Microsoft.\\nThe NSA keeps a chest of cyberweapons to itself so it can hit targets, but Microsoft has long argued that this is dangerous. If there is a flaw in Windows, the company said, surely the safest thing to do is to let its team know straight away so it can be fixed.\\nBut then Microsoft also needs to consider what obligation it has to update all users - not just the ones who pay extra for security on older systems.\\nUpdating your computer if you\\'re an individual is a piece of cake, but for a network the size of Britain\\'s National Health Service? Tough - time-consuming, expensive and complex.\\nFor a company like Microsoft to say it won\\'t keep those systems safe unless they shell out more money, then that in itself is something of a ransom.\\nMeanwhile Europol\\'s chief told the BBC that that the ransomware was designed to allow \"infection of one computer to quickly spread across the networks\", adding: \"That\\'s why we\\'re seeing these numbers increasing all the time.\"\\nAlthough a temporary fix earlier slowed the infection rate, the attackers had now released a new version of the virus, he said.\\nA UK security researcher known as \"MalwareTech\", who helped to limit the ransomware attack, predicted \"another one coming... quite likely on Monday\".\\nMalwareTech, who wants to remain anonymous, was hailed as an \"accidental hero\" after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus, which actually ended up halting it.\\nBecky Pinkard, from Digital Shadows, a UK-based cyber-security firm, told AFP news agency that it would be easy for the initial attackers or \"copy-cat authors\" to change the virus code so it is difficult to guard against.\\n\"Even if a fresh attack does not materialise on Monday, we should expect it soon afterwards,\" she said.\\nIn England, 48 National Health Service (NHS) trusts reported problems at hospitals, doctor surgeries or pharmacies, and 13 NHS organisations in Scotland were also affected.\\nOther organisations targeted worldwide included Germany\\'s rail network Deutsche Bahn, Spanish telecommunications operator Telefonica, French carmaker Renault, US logistics giant FedEx and Russia\\'s Interior Ministry.']\n",

It is the first such move for 67 years.\\nThe bonds that Chancellor George Osborne has acquired have a lower rate than the 4% interest on the debt.\\nThe continued existence of the war bond debt illustrates the lasting shadow cast by World War One.\\nAccording to the UK Treasury there are currently 11,200 registered holders of the bonds.\\nWinston Churchill first issued \"4% Consols\" in 1927 when he was Chancellor partly to refinance bonds from the First World War.\\nIn addition to the war bonds, some of the debt being refinanced by the Treasury dates back to the 18th Century.\\nOne of these bonds was issued by William Gladstone in 1853 to consolidate the capital stock of the South Sea Company, which was founded in 1711.\\nThe South Sea Company collapsed during the South Sea Bubble financial crisis of 1720, leaving behind it a lot of debt.\\nIn 1932 Chancellor Neville Chamberlain converted some war bonds into \"perpetuals\". This gave the government the right not to pay back the loans, as long as they continued paying 3.5% interest on them.\\nPerpetual bonds, as the name suggests, pay a steady stream of interest forever.', 'Mr Biden is considering running for president and accounts depicting him as hesitant to attack Bin Laden have been seen as a political liability.\\n\"Mr President, my suggestion is, don\\'t go,\" Mr Biden told congressmen in 2012, according to ABC News.\\nBut on Tuesday Mr Biden said he told President Obama privately to proceed.\\n\"As we walked out of the room and walked upstairs, I said - I told him my opinion that I thought he should go, but follow his own instincts,\" Mr Biden said at an event in Washington.\\n\"I never... say what I think finally until I go up in the Oval [Office] with him alone,\" he added.\\nIn May 2011, Mr Obama authorised the operation. US special forces shot and killed Bin Laden at a compound near Islamabad.\\nHillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time, has said publicly that she supported the raid.\\nBin Laden was widely believed to have been behind the bombings of US embassies in East Africa, the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000 and the 2001 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington.\\nIn recent months, supporters have encouraged Mr Biden to challenge Mrs Clinton for the Democratic nomination.\\nHowever, Mr Biden, 72, has questioned whether he has the \"emotional energy\" to run after the death of his son Beau in May.\\nOthers say by entering the race so late Mr Biden may not be able to rally enough financial support to mount an effective campaign.\\nAfter a strong performance in the first Democratic presidential debate last week, Mrs Clinton has seen her poll number rebound after a summer which saw her support wane.\\nMrs Clinton maintains healthy leads in most early voting states even after factoring Mr Biden into the race.\\nMr Biden expects to decide within days because deadlines to appear on the ballot in key states are fast approaching.\\nThe former Delaware senator failed in his bids for the White House in 1988 and 2008 before becoming Mr Obama\\'s running mate.', 'The former Barclays chief executive has made the offer through his Atlas Merchant Capital vehicle and QInvest, the Qataris\\' investment arm.\\nQInvest already owns 43% of Panmure, a firm that dates back some 140 years.\\nThe offer, which values Panmure at Â£15.5m, has been recommended by the board.\\nShares in the company soared 76% to 105p in morning trading - 5p above the offer price.\\nAndrew Adcock, chairman, said the independent directors believed the offer was \"fair and reasonable\".\\nMatthew Hansen, head of UK and Europe for Atlas, said there was a \"significant opportunity to enhance Panmure Gordon\\'s strong reputation and build a larger, successful boutique investment bank\".\\nThat could only be done as a private company, \"out of the glare of the public market and the effects of share price movement\".\\nQInvest bought its stake in Panmure in 2009. Tamim Al-Kawari, its chief executive, said it was \"excited about this opportunity to work with Atlas to develop the business, alongside its management team and employees, and to assist it in fulfilling its potential\".\\nThe deal will be regarded as a return to the City by Mr Diamond, who resigned from Barclays in the wake of the Libor rigging scandal in 2012.\\nThe Boston-born banker was a controversial figure. Before being elevated to run the bank in September 2010, he was head of Barclays Capital, its investment banking division.\\nFormer Labour minister Lord Mandelson described Mr Diamond as the \"unacceptable face of banking\", claiming he had been paid a salary of Â£63m for \"deal-making and shuffling paper around\".\\nBarclays dismissed the figure as \"total fiction\", saying that his salary as head of Barclays Capital was actually Â£250,000.\\nHe joined Barclays in 1996, having worked in senior roles at Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley International.\\nAs the global financial system teetered on the brink in 2008, Mr Diamond won praise for his role in the successful and profitable takeover of the US operations of Lehman Brothers.\\nThe deal, which he described as \"transformational\", catapulted Barclays into the top league of global investment banks.\\nThe bank declined a bailout by the UK government at the height of the credit crunch crisis and instead sold a large stake to foreign investors, mainly from Qatar and Abu Dhabi, to raise cash.', 'Ray Cole, from Deal, Kent, was detained with his Moroccan partner by police who approached the pair at a bus stop in Marrakech last month, his family said.\\nHis son Adrian Cole said the retired magazine publisher, 69, was jailed for four months on Thursday.\\nDover and Deal MP Charlie Elphicke warned travellers that Morocco was unsafe for British tourists.\\nThe Conservative MP told the Pink News: \"I have been doing all I can to help free Mr Cole from these appalling charges.\\n\"I urge people not to visit Morocco.

Anyone with information is urged to contact Surrey Police.', 'The court, which is dominated by government loyalists, said Luisa Ortega Díaz had committed serious errors.\\nMs Ortega, once a staunch government ally, broke ranks in March when she said an attempt by the Supreme Court to strip the opposition-controlled Congress of its powers was unlawful.\\nCritics believe President Nicolás Maduro is trying to push Ms Ortega out.\\nShe faces a hearing on 4 July - some analysts say she may eventually be put on trial. The move comes amid growing political turmoil in Venezuela.\\nAccording to reports, the accusations against her refer to the appointment of judges.\\nThe Supreme Court recently transferred Ms Ortega\\'s powers of investigation to the national  ombudsman.\\nOn Wednesday, she strongly criticised President Maduro following an incident in which a stolen police helicopter flew over government buildings in the capital, Caracas, dropping grenades and firing shots.\\nMr Maduro called it a \"terrorist attack\" but Ms Ortega said Venezuela was suffering from \"state terrorism\" due to the harsh response by authorities to anti-government protests.\\nThe suspected pilot, a rogue elite police officer identifying himself as Oscar Pérez, posted Instagram videos admitting the attack and calling on Venezuelans to rise up against the government.\\nVenezuelan security forces later said they had found the helicopter, near the north coast in the state of Vargas. There was no sign of the pilot.\\nAndrew Rosati, a Caracas-based journalist for news website Bloomberg, said some people doubted the government\\'s version of events.\\n\"I spoke to people today on the streets and some are absolutely mystified by the whole affair,\" he told the BBC\\'s Newsday programme.\\n\"This idea that a helicopter almost vanished into the air, flew off into the sunset. Many think this whole thing is staged by the government.\"\\nOpposition politician and parliamentary Speaker Julio Borges also raised the possibility that the incident was a hoax but said more information was needed.\\n\"Whatever it is, it is very serious,\" he said. \"It all points to one conclusion: that the situation in Venezuela is unsustainable.\"\\nThere have been almost daily anti-government protests in Venezuela for more than two months as the country\\'s economic and political crisis worsens.', 'An £8.6bn deficit on goods was partially offset by an estimated surplus of £7.4bn on services, it said.\\nThe ONS added that in the quarter to April, exports were flat after 0.3% growth in the first quarter, but imports were up 2.1%, the same as in the three months to March.\\nUK exporters have struggled in the face of weak demand in the eurozone.\\nPart of the deficit dip was down to a fall in imports of art and furniture, said the ONS. Another factor was less oil being imported.\\nLast year, companies began stockpiling oil as the price of the commodity collapsed.\\nThe deficit - a description of how much imports exceed exports by value -  was less than economists had expected.\\n\"Monthly trade figures are notoriously volatile but today\\'s significant improvement is nonetheless very welcome, but there is no room for any complacency,\" said David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce.\\n\"The longer-term trend still shows a worsening in the trade position in recent months. It is clear that we are not making enough, sustained, progress in closing the trade gap.\"\\nThe UK\\'s trade deficit for 2014 widened to £34.8bn, the biggest gap since 2010.', 'Media playback is not supported on this device\\nThe five-time winners were thrashed by a German side who were 5-0 up in the first 29 minutes.\\n\"They were better than us,\" said Luiz, who captained Brazil in the absence of Thiago Silva. \"It\\'s a very sad day but it\\'s also a day from which to learn.\\n\"Apologies to all the Brazilian people. I just wanted to see my people smile.\"\\nBrazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar described his team\\'s collapse as a \"blackout\" and the defeat as \"inexplicable\".\\nThe 34-year-old, who is on loan at Toronto from QPR, said: \"It was beautiful up to here.\\n\"I thank the Brazilian people, and the fans are to be congratulated for all the support they gave us.\\n\"The players are going to apologise, but Germany were strong, and we have to acknowledge that.\"\\nLuiz, who moved from Chelsea to Paris St-Germain in a transfer reportedly worth £40m earlier this summer, was to blame for the vital first goal, when he failed to track Thomas Muller before the German scored from a corner.\\nBBC Match of the Day pundit Alan Hansen, a three-time European Cup winner with Liverpool, described Luiz\\'s performance as \"one of the worst I have ever seen\".\\nHowever, Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari took responsibility for the defeat.\\n\"I will be remembered as the coach to lose 7-1 but I knew that risk when I took the job,\" said Scolari, a World Cup winner with Brazil in 2002.\\n\"The person who decided the line-up, the tactics, was me. It was my choice.\"']\n",

It turned out to be someone who worked in the intelligence services of a country in the coalition.\"\\nScotland Yard has previously denied that it took three days to inform Turkey about the missing girls, saying it began working with Turkish authorities the day after they disappeared.\\nUK police officers have since travelled to Turkey as part of their investigation.\\nThe head of the Met Police apologised to the girls\\' parents earlier this week after they failed to receive a letter intended for them.\\nThe families had complained after the letter - about a fellow school friend who went to Syria last year - was given to the girls instead of being sent directly to them.\\nSir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he was sorry the letter \"didn\\'t get through\" but told the Home Affairs Select Committee there was nothing more police could have done to prevent the girls leaving for Syria.\\nThe families of the schoolgirls told the committee they would have done more to monitor the girls if they had known one of their friends had already gone to Syria.\\nAbout 20 women and girls are thought to have gone to Syria from the UK in the past year, probably to join militant groups.', 'A report published by the Welsh Government showed 79.5 million prescriptions were issued in 2015, compared to 78.5 million the previous year.\\nThe overall cost of Wales\\' prescription policy - which became free in 2007 - was Â£593.7m, up 3.5% on 2014.\\nThe number of prescriptions handed out has risen by 40% over the last decade.\\nA Welsh Government spokesman said prescribing decisions were \"a matter for GPs and other prescribers based on their professional judgement and the person\\'s clinical needs\".\\n\"This has not altered with the introduction of free prescriptions.\"\\nThe report showed Wales also remained the UK nation that dispenses more prescriptions per person - 25.7 compared to 21.6 in Northern Ireland, 20 in England and 19 in Scotland.\\nThe Welsh Government spokesman added: \"The number of prescription items dispensed in England increased by 36% between 2007 and 2015.\\n\"In Wales, the number of prescription items dispensed increased by 28% over the same period.\"\\nMair Davies, Royal Pharmaceutical Society director for Wales, said: \"Prescribers in Wales issue the greatest number of prescriptions per head in the four home countries due to a number of reasons.\\n\"Demographic change, the associated prevalence of chronic conditions in older people, the legacy of heavy industry all contribute to the greater number of prescriptions issued in our country.\\n\"These statistics demonstrate that pharmacists in Wales continue to work exceptionally hard to provide patients with the service they need.\"', 'More and more, financial firms are turning to machines to do the job humans have done for decades.\\nLast spring, wealth management firm Charles Schwab launched a new service called Schwab Intelligent Portfolios. The service is unique in that it\\'s not a person who decides where to invest your money, it\\'s an algorithm - lines of code programmed into a computer.\\n\"It\\'s lower cost for the investor,\" says Tobin McDaniel, who leads the Schwab Intelligent Portfolios team.\\n\"As opposed to working with a traditional advisor where you might pay up to 1%, here you get portfolio management at essentially no management fee.\"\\nTo get started with Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, you answer a short questionnaire aimed at determining your appetite for risk and your investment goals. Algorithms then create a portfolio suited to your profile and manage it on a daily basis.\\nInstead of simply crunching numbers, the machines are now making decisions.\\nAnd that increasingly describes the rest of the financial system.\\nMachines are now responsible for most of the activity on Wall Street.\\nAnd just this summer, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group closed most of its trading pits after 167 years.\\nThe practice of traders shouting and using hand signals to buy and sell commodities had become outdated. The work they once did has been replaced by a much quieter competitor - the computer.\\nBrad Bailey is a research director at Celent, and an expert on electronic trading.\\n\"Before we were limited to human response time, which is about half of a second or about the blink of an eye,\" he says\\n\"Now when you think about trading, things are happening in nanoseconds, or certainly milliseconds.\"\\nSupporters say computers boost liquidity, helping would-be buyers and sellers find one another without middlemen.\\nThen there are the high frequency traders. They zip in and out of shares so quickly, and on such a massive scale, that their fortunes are lost and made by tiny price movements.\\nOther algorithms rely more on artificial intelligence to pour over earnings statements, news reports and regulatory filings looking for clues on how to view a stock.\\nWhile these lines of code are faster and more efficient than people, Brad Bailey warns that \"[a] lot can happen in those time frames before humans can react\".\\nNot all of it good.\\nIn 2012 US market maker Knight Capital lost over $400m (Â£261m) in 30 minutes because of a computer glitch. And this summer trading was halted at the New York Stock Exchange following a software problem.\\nThese events have raised doubts about the stability of computerised trading systems. Critics argue it has made markets more volatile.\\nAnd what about trading rules? Are they fit for purpose with markets that now handle orders in milliseconds?\\n\"We live in a world where you can\\'t prevent every problem,\" says Ron Geffner, a former Securities and Exchange Commission attorney who now works with hedge funds.\\n\"It takes time for regulators to spot the problems, become aware of it, and once they become aware of it to adopt rules.\"\\nTo prevent big swings, US financial regulators have implemented a raft of measures including single stock circuit breakers. The rule requires a pause in trading for individual stocks if the price moves 10% or more in a five-minute period.\\nAnd companies like Charles Schwab have also instituted safeguards.\\nJust this August, when the Dow fell more than 1,000 points during the trading session, Charles Schwab convened a panel of people to check if the huge volume of orders its Schwab Intelligent Portfolios was about to place was the right move.\\nTodd McDaniel tells the BBC: \"We\\'ve got a human checkpoint\".\\nPeople still have a role in the financial system but it\\'s changing. On Wall Street at least, it\\'s a machine\\'s world.']\n",

His aides say it is about empowering communities, redistributing power and fostering a culture of volunteerism.\\nPerhaps no wonder then that Tory candidates during the general election found it difficult to sell the idea to voters.\\nSo why is David Cameron returning to this theme ?\\nIn part because he does view it as his answer to Big Government - but there are also more basic political motives.\\nFirst, it\\'s about providing a different agenda to the day by day litany of cuts, cuts and more cuts.\\nSecond, it is  - as Eric Pickles has acknowledged - about saving money. If people are doing things for free then you don\\'t have to pay public servants to do them for you.\\nSo beneath the grand-sounding philosophy there is hard-nosed,  practical politics behind the \\'big society\\' message.\\nMore analysis from across the web\\nThe initiatives being championed include a local buy-out of a rural pub, efforts to recruit volunteers to keep museums open, support to speed up broadband supply, and giving residents more power over council spending.\\nThese schemes and others in the future, he said, would represent \"the biggest, most dramatic redistribution of power from elites in Whitehall to the man and woman on the street\".\\nIn the past, he said, the talents and initiative of people had been wasted, claiming that over-centralised government had turned public sector workers into the \"weary, disillusioned puppets of government targets\".\\nMr Cameron acknowledged the transformation he was seeking would not happen overnight and stressed it was not a matter of the government stepping aside and letting people fend for themselves.\\n\"Of course there is not one lever you can simply pull to create a big society,\" he said.\\n\"We should not be naive enough to think that simply if government rolls back and does less, then miraculously society will spring up and do more.\\n\"The truth is we need a government that helps to build a big society.\"\\nAs well as encouraging greater volunteering and philanthropy, Mr Cameron confirmed plans to use funds stuck in dormant bank and building society accounts to enable \"some of the most dynamic\" charities, social enterprises and voluntary groups to take over the running of public services.\\nIt is hoped that hundreds of millions of pounds will eventually be available in start-up funding through a Big Society Bank, to be matched by private investment.\\nMr Cameron rejected suggestions that the plans were \"cover\" for substantial cuts in public services due next year and that the public were either confused by or uninterested in the proposals.\\n\"I don\\'t accept that people don\\'t understand what this is,\" he said.\\nEveryone was aware of the \"great work\" that volunteers were already doing in communities up and down the country, he said, and it was his ambition to simply expand this.\\n\"It is incredibly simple idea and one, I think, is catching on,\" he said.\\nShadow Cabinet Office minister Tessa Jowell called Mr Cameron\\'s speech \"a brass-necked rebranding of programmes already put in place by a Labour government\".\\nShe added: \"We welcome the coalition\\'s decision to continue our work in partnership with local communities, but these projects are dependant on funding and resources being put in place.\\n\"It is therefore highly unlikely that civil society will become \\'bigger\\' due to the large public spending cuts that are being put forward by this government.\"\\nVoluntary groups broadly welcomed the idea but expressed concerns about how equipped they were to take on more responsibility, given that public funds were likely to be cut as part of the budget squeeze.\\n\"It is going to be very challenging for them to play a bigger role if they have less resources to do it,\" said Ben Kernighan, from the National Council for Voluntary Organisations.\\nAnd union leaders said public services must be based on certainty of provision and not whether there were enough volunteers on any given day.\\n\"Make no mistake, this plan is all about saving money,\" Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said.\\n\"The government is simply washing its hands of providing decent public services and using volunteers as a cut-price alternative.\"', 'The Department of Health said it wanted to reduce the £2.8bn a year pharmacy bill by more than £200m over the next two years.\\nIt has been suggested cuts on this scale could lead to up to 3,000 of the 11,700 pharmacies being closed.\\nCurrently, the average pharmacy receives £220,000 a year from the NHS.\\nThis accounts for between 80% and 90% of their income and includes a flat rate of £25,000, which nearly all pharmacies receive.\\nThe changes being announced scrap that and put much more emphasis on performance-related funding, with ministers understood to see the current system as outdated and inefficient.\\nFigures previously provided by the Department of Health - it has been looking into the issue for some months - suggested the number of pharmacies had increased by a fifth in the past 12 years.\\nAnd it has said about 40% of community pharmacies are found in clusters - with three or more within 10 minutes\\' walk of each other.\\nThe pharmacy industry has been lobbying ministers in recent months, warning the move could put more pressure on GPs and accident and emergency departments, as pharmacists provide advice and support to patients.\\nBut Health Minister David Mowat said the government had decided to press on despite these protests, as the current system was not the best use of \"valuable\" NHS resources.\\n\"Far from jeopardising services, our modernisation package will help improve them,\" he added.\\nHe said special funds would be set up to support pharmacies in isolated areas and to help set up more in GP surgeries and hospitals, which would be \"more convenient\" for patients.\\nMinisters believe these two measures will help offset the closure of High Street pharmacies - it expects another 1,500 GP surgeries will have in-house pharmacists by 2020. These are much cheaper to run.\\nBut Sandra Gidley, of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said she was \"deeply disappointed\".\\n\"We fear for patients, the public and pharmacists who may be significantly affected by changes in opening hours and staffing levels in community pharmacy, as well as the knock on impact on already pressured GP and A&E NHS care.\"\\nAnd Shadow Health Secretary Barbara Keeley said the move would be \"damaging\" and lead to increased demand on the health service as well as pharmacies.\\n\"The government\\'s plans are not only deeply unpopular, they are short-sighted and they will hit areas with the greatest health inequalities hardest,\" she added.\\nRead more from Nick\\nFollow Nick on Twitter', 'Steven Greenwell, 42, flew in to Aberdeen Airport on Tuesday but has not made contact with friends or family since.\\nMr Greenwell, who is originally from Scotland but now lives in France, is 5ft 8in, of slim build and has short, fair hair.\\nPolice said he was likely to be dressed in walking clothes.\\nSgt Garry Garrow said: \"I would appeal to anyone with information regarding Steven\\'s whereabouts, or who may have seen Steven recently to please get in touch.\\n\"Although it is believed that Steven is a competent and experienced hillwalker, the lack of contact from him is concerning for his friends and family. I would also ask Steven to contact someone to let them know that he is ok.\"', \"According to Steve, Monterey Bay in California, USA is one of the most special places in the world and at this time of year it's home to many different species of wildlife.\\nOver the next week Big Blue Live will be shining a light on the underwater world and the mesmerising animals that call the sea their home...\\nHere are some of the animals you can expect to see over the next few days.\"]\n",

I thought it was a drain overflowing so went to drive through it.\\n\"Then all of a sudden the car was sucked across the road and I ended up in the hole in the road.\\n\"The water came flooding in over my knees and eventually the water was above the dashboard.\\n\"It was fairly hard to escape... the car kept locking and unlocking itself so I had to get out of the passenger side which was difficult.\"\\nGerald Douglas, who lives opposite the sinkhole, said: \"It sounded like an explosion at the time and thought it must be a distant one.\\n\"I came out and the lane was in floods... It was quite a surprise on a Sunday morning.\"\\nMr Douglas said the \"flow of water was extreme\" and drifted to about 20m away from the car.\\nThe water company said the sinkhole in the road was an \"extreme example\" of what happens when a large pipe bursts.\\nJames Gunn said he woke up in the early hours to find the downstairs of his home flooded, as did many other residents in the village.\\n\"It\\'s a crisis in some ways, but the village has reacted marvellously,\" he said.\\n\"The same thing happened 30 years ago - hope it doesn\\'t happen again.\"\\nMr Gunn added that his home \"will dry out, but it\\'s a nuisance\" to clean it up.\\nUp to 20,000 homes have been affected by the burst pipe, including East Bridgford, Upper Saxondale and Flintham.\\n\"Due to the size of the water pipe, a lot of villages and towns in the area have been left without water,\" STW said.\\n\"We\\'ve managed to get more people back on supply... and we\\'ve got teams working hard to get everyone else on as soon as possible.\"\\nSTW expects all affected homes to have their supply restored by 21:00 GMT.']\n",

He had been arrested over the weekend and held in police custody.\", 'Durham paceman James Weighell took his first five-wicket haul as the Bears, 15-2 overnight, slumped to 114 all out.\\nChris Wright then hit back with four wickets as Durham slipped to 87-4.\\nBut visiting opener Keaton Jennings remained to make an unbeaten 88 to steer his side to 154-4 at the close.\\nBacked by a gritty 26 from captain Paul Collingwood over the final hour and a half of the day, the pair have so far put on an unbroken 67 for the fifth wicket.\\nAnd, if they are still together for a further hour and a half on the final day, then the visitors ought to have the game won.\\nTrailing by 123 on first innings, Durham bowled out Warwickshire inside 38 overs, only Varun Chopra (34), Jonathan Trott (26) and captain Ian Bell (15) reaching double figures.\\nWeighell took 5-33 to complete new career-best match figures of 9-130, backed chiefly by former England Test seamer Graham Onions, who added the wicket of Keith Barker to his late Monday evening brace to finish with 3-36.\\nWith no Chris Woakes to combat, Durham\\'s openers made a strong start in their pursuit of 238 to win, Jennings and Mark Stoneman having knocked off 67 from 28 overs by tea - their sixth half-century partnership this season.\\nWright then removed Stoneman for 23, the first of four wickets for the England Lions man in 23 deliveries to turn the contest once more. But South African Jennings and Collingwood, just two days before his 40th birthday, ensured that there would be no further alarms.\\nWarwickshire fast bowler Chris Wright:\\n\"It is delicately poised. They are slight favourites but we have seen in this game that, once you get on a roll, wickets do fall quite quickly. If we come fast out of the blocks and take an early wicket or two, then we are in with a great chance.\\n\"They batted calmly at the end. As a side, they have played Jeetan Patel exceptionally well. Jeets has bowled well without taking any wickets.\\n\"But Woakesie bowled exceptionally well to take nine wickets and to lose a player who has had that much impact on the game is a big deal.\\n\"There is a little movement in the pitch and a little bit of rough which hopefully the spinners can work with. The heavy roller has taken a little bit of the sting out of it but it is still a wicket where if you bowl well you can get bits out of it.\"\\nDurham opener Keaton Jennings:\\n\"It\\'s been a great game with everything from a beautiful debutant hundred to a nine-for to a great finish with us just needing 84 runs on the final day. It will be an exciting day.\\n\"It\\'s been a good season so far for Mark Stoneman and myself. Mark has played beautifully without kind of racing away.\\n\"It\\'s a wicket that is really tough to get in on, as you can see from so many guys facing 15 to 30 balls then getting out.\\n\"We have got to get in and make sure we really drive the game deep and give ourselves a platform to score those runs.\"', 'They have until 24 March to send in a postal ballot choosing between the current flag and an alternative called Silver Fern, which won a previous vote.\\nThe exercise has been controversial with many criticising the hefty price tag and shortlisted designs.\\nPM John Key says the current one looks too similar to Australia\\'s and it is time to remove the Union Flag emblem.\\nIn pictures: Weird and wonderful entries that lost out\\nWhat do schoolchildren think of the new designs?\\nThe alternative design, Silver Fern (Black, White and Blue), was designed by architect Kyle Lockwood.\\nIt won the first referendum in December, where New Zealanders could choose which of five designs they would want if the flag were to change.\\nAbout 1.5 million votes were cast in that referendum.\\nThis time, they are deciding whether they want to abandon the current flag - which was adopted in 1902 and bears the British Union Flag - in favour of Silver Fern.\\nMr Key has argued for a more distinctive look for New Zealand\\'s flag, and has said it is also time to drop the Union Jack.\\nThe prime minister, who backs the alternative design, said earlier this week it was New Zealand\\'s last chance for change.\\n\"If they don\\'t vote for change now, they\\'ll never get another chance until we become a republic,\" he said in a Radio New Zealand interview on Monday, adding that he did not think that would happen within his lifetime given the current popularity of the British royal family.\\nSilver Fern and the four other finalists were chosen by a committee from a large pool of entries submitted by the public, including designs featuring a kiwi shooting lasers out of its eyes and hand-drawn sheep.\\nBut they were criticised by many as being uninspiring or safe. Many took issue as well with the NZ$27m ($18m; Â£12m) cost of the exercise, saying it was expensive and unnecessary.', 'A motion was put forward at the bank\\'s annual meeting and needed 75% of shareholders to vote in favour.\\nHowever only 64.7% of those present backed the plan, with the German government using its 17% voting stake to vote against it.\\nCommerzbank was rescued by the government in 2008.\\nUnder new rules introduced by the European Union in the wake of the financial crisis, shareholder approval is needed for any bonus plan that exceeds an employee\\'s base salary.\\nThe finance ministry said the bank had failed to provide a convincing explanation for why such a bonus was needed.\\nHowever it did approve a separate proposal to allow certain executives to receive compensation worth 140% of their pay.\\nThis \"sets sensible incentives to reach targets and successfully implement strategic goals that the federal government will ultimately benefit from\", it said in a statement.\\nSeparately, Commerzbank said it would launch an internal investigation into the actions that led to it paying a $1.45bn settlement in the US for violating economic sanctions against businesses in Iran and Sudan.']\n",

Jakeway said.\\nThe 12 deliberate fires involved vehicles or refuse being set alight.', 'The £500,000 project at the Captain Cook Birthplace Museum at Stewart Park in Middlesbrough was funded by an Arts Council grant.\\nGalleries have been revamped and a new exhibition set up.\\nThis features artwork and natural history specimens from Cook\\'s voyages, some on loan from attractions including the Natural History Museum.\\nEntitled \"Gotta Catch \\'Em All\", it features the 18th Century natural scientists and artists who sailed with Cook, and their collection of natural history specimens, which had never been seen before in Europe.\\nThere is also a new \"Cabinet of Curiosities\" which houses books, objects and ephemera all linked to the explorer.\\nA resources room holds items ranging from original 18th century engravings to books published this year.\\nSenior curator Phil Philo said: \"It\\'s all perfectly timed as the museum prepares for next year\\'s celebrations marking the 250th anniversary of the start of Captain Cook\\'s First Voyage aboard Endeavour to the Pacific Ocean, and his exploration of the Society Islands, New Zealand and the East coast of Australia.\"', 'Roger Smith was concerned about an attack similar to that on fusilier Lee Rigby in London in 2014, Nottingham Crown Court was told.\\nThe 46-year-old was found guilty of two counts of having explosive substances at his home in Clifton in Nottingham.\\nHe was also found guilty of having a document for terrorist purposes.\\nThat charge related to a copy of the Anarchy Cookbook Version 2000, a guide to making bombs based on The Anarchist Cookbook.\\nJurors heard that police first became aware of Smith in June 2014 because of a dispute with his neighbours concerning hedges and garden fires.\\nPCSO Matthew Holden said he had several dealings with the defendant, who openly told him he had a compound bow and a set of three knives.\\nHe told jurors Smith was concerned about \"a terrorist attack or Islamic attack similar to the Lee Rigby attack\", said \"Islam was at war with the West\" and \"believed a citizen should have the right to bear arms\".\\nPolice searched Mr Smith\\'s home on 21 October 2015 and found gunpowder and large amounts of chemicals that could be used to make explosives along with a copy of the Anarchy Cookbook Version 2000.\\nIn his police interview, Smith said he made the gunpowder to entertain his young relatives by lighting it in the garden.\\nHe claimed he had the other chemicals for legitimate purposes and had the weapons because he was a \"survivalist\" who liked to shoot arrows in his garden.\\nSmith bought a second copy of the Anarchy Cookbook from Amazon while awaiting trial which he said was to use as evidence for his defence.\\nHe was charged with an extra offence for making that purchase but the jury cleared him.\\nHe is due to be sentenced on 16 December.', 'The club is also facing a charge of bringing the game into disrepute, Scottish Football Association chief executive Stewart Regan announced.\\nRangers also face disciplinary action unless they pay money due to Dundee United for a Scottish Cup tie.\\nThe club\\'s administrators say they look forward to putting forward their case.\\nRegan heard the findings at a special board meeting at Hampden on Thursday.\\nA statement by Regan said: \"Principally, it is the belief of the board, taking into account the prima facie evidence presented today, that Mr Craig Whyte is not considered to be a fit and proper person to hold a position within Association Football.\\n\"We will be writing to Mr Whyte in relation to those findings and shall seek a response within seven days.\\n\"The report submitted by Lord Nimmo Smith, having been considered fully by the board, highlights a number of other potential rule breaches by the club and its owner.\\nWe believe there are mitigating factors and we hope to demonstrate the distinction between the club and the actions of any individuals\\n\"The report will now be used as evidence and forwarded to a judicial panel for consideration and determination as per the protocol.\"\\nWithin minutes of the SFA announcement, Paul Clark, joint administrator, said: \"We note the findings and announcement by the Scottish Football Association.\\n\"We look forward to stating the club\\'s case to the judicial panel.\\n\"In broad terms, we believe there are mitigating factors and we hope to demonstrate the distinction between the club and the actions of any individuals.\"\\nWhyte\\'s takeover of Rangers in May is the subject of a Strathclyde Police investigation.\\nThe Scottish businessman put Rangers into administration at the Court of Session in Edinburgh on 14 February, under pressure from Her Majesty\\'s Revenue and Customs for non-payment of PAYE and VAT.\\nAt the time, the figure owed to HMRC was thought to be £9m but BBC Scotland has since learned that £15m is a more accurate assessment of the debt.\\nThe plunge into administration attracted a 10-point penalty by the Scottish Premier League.\\nWhyte\\'s preference for administrator Duff & Phelps was accepted by the court and since mid-February they have been auditing the Ibrox club\\'s books.\\nOn Wednesday, after protracted talks with players collapsed about tiered wage cuts to save £1m in monthly costs, the administrators said they were now rushing to push through the sale of the club.\\nHaving earlier intimated 16 March as their cut-off point, they set Friday as the date for interested parties to show their hand and for their cost-cutting plans to be accepted by the players.\\nAdministrator David Whitehouse warned that without an injection of cash or an agreement over cuts, the firm would begin to make severe cuts to the playing squad, a scenario it is keen to avoid because it would damage the value of the asset - the club - that it is trying to sell.\\nAnd he said that the reigning Scottish champions might be unable to fulfil its remaining fixtures this season.']\n",

If he had not been stopped, he would have flown the aircraft to Islamabad. That could have had potential catastrophic consequences.\\n\"Many people find flying a difficult and nervous ordeal at the best of times. They need to have absolute confidence in their safety and security.\"\\nIn a statement, a spokesman for Pakistan International Airlines said \"further action\" would be taken against Faiz once he had completed his sentence in the UK.\\n\"The maximum sentence is termination from service,\" he said.', 'The 29-year-old, who is currently in Rio hosting coverage of the Olympic Games, said he was \"a huge fan\" of the show and \"cannot wait to get started\".\\n\"I\\'m still waiting for someone to wake me up and tell me I\\'m dreaming!

She'd had cancer treatment at The Royal Marsden, a hospital that Prince William supports.\\nBut like every good journalist, things didn't quite go to plan for Alice - she got the prince's name wrong, calling him Prince Harry instead!\\nEight years on, he's been reunited with Alice, but does he remember her slip-up?\\nWatch the video to find out.\", 'Wallace called on Stevenage Borough Council to take action to improve the North Stand, branding it \"not fit for purpose\".\\nHe claimed without the development the future of the club was in doubt.\\nStevenage Borough Council, the ground\\'s landlord, said they were not able to provide financial support.\\nThe club, who sit a point outside the play-off places in League Two, submitted plans to redevelop the North Stand at the Lamex Stadium last year and this gained approval from the council.\\nStevenage have offered to pay £900,000 towards the cost of the £1.4 million development - including a £450,000 grant from the Football Foundation - but the council said they could not contribute to the project because of \"ongoing financial challenges\".\\nWallace said: \"The 50-year old facilities were second rate when built and are now truly awful.\\n\"We want the council to stand with the club and bring the town\\'s stadium - which they own - up to the standard expected in the EFL today.\\n\"Wheelchair users are open to the elements, half the end has no cover and the toilets are a disgrace. How is that acceptable?\\n\"Unless we can find a solution that provides decent facilities for future generations, there is little point in being an EFL club, which brings the very future of the club into doubt.\"\\nStevenage lease the football ground from Stevenage Borough Council, who own the land. The council previously helped the club develop the other three sides of the Lamex Stadium.\\n\"Our government funding has been reduced by almost £5 million since 2010, and we need to make a further million pounds of savings in the next three years,\" a council statement read.\\n\"We recognise and are grateful for the contribution that the football club makes to the town.\\n\"We have given Stevenage FC both financial and \\'in-kind\\' support for many years, and will continue to do what we can to support the club, but this will not involve the commitment of scarce public funds.\"', 'The high court in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand said this would help in the \"preservation and conservation\" of the highly polluted rivers.\\nIt added that the \"legal status\" ensures that polluting the rivers would now amount to harming a human being.\\nBoth rivers are considered sacred in India and are considered goddesses by the majority Hindu population.\\nThe ruling comes a week after the Whanganui River in New Zealand became the first in the world to be granted the same legal rights as a person.\\nThe court said in its ruling that Hindus had \"deep faith\" in the two rivers and they \"collectively connect with them\".\\n\"The rivers are central to the existence of half of the Indian population and their health and well being. They have provided both physical and spiritual sustenance to all of us from time immemorial,\" it added.\\nIt went on to add that both rivers had become heavily polluted due to industrialisation and rapid urbanisation.\\nTwo top state officials have been appointed as the \"legal guardians\" of the rivers and will represent their rights.\\nActivists say the order is likely to fast track efforts to clean the rivers.', 'The fire started in the premises at Bingnian Drive off the Glen Road at about 04:30 BST on Sunday and police said an explosion was reported.\\nThe shop units may have to be demolished as the blaze caused structural damage to the property.\\nOwner Steven Comerford said he did not know why his business was targeted.\\n\"We\\'ve been in the community [for] 18 to 20 years,\" he said.\\n\"Just don\\'t know why somebody would want to do something like that.\\n\"It\\'s hard enough with the day-to-day runnings of a business and to manage staff and do your daily routines, without the added pressure of [wondering] where do we go from here.\"\\nPolice have appealed for witnesses.']\n",

They deny the charges.\\nMr Phillips is accused of two thefts, while Mr Stokes denies three charges.\\nAfter Mr Evans was acquitted, the jury at Cardiff Crown Court heard the final prosecution evidence against Mr Phillips.\\nThe jury was told that Mr Phillips was dismissed from South Wales Police after admitting stealing cash in a separate incident.\\nIt followed an \"integrity test\", in which the former officer was filmed during a staged scenario.\\nHe was seen taking £240 from a coat and £10 from a bedside cabinet.\\nIt was also claimed Mr Phillips stole £8,100 in cash from a police evidence storage room, which was said to be the money seized from from a safe during a raid at a house in Swansea in 2011.\\nThe trial continues.', \"32-year-old McLeod most recently played for Yeovil Town where he scored once in six appearances before his release.\\nJennings, 29, joins the National League club for the rest of the season.\\nMeanwhile, Wrexham have cancelled the contracts of Kai Edwards, Nortei Nortey and Tyler Harvey while defender Jordan Evans' contract has been extended.\", 'At least 21 firefighters are among the dead, with another 721 people injured after the blasts at a warehouse storing hazardous materials.\\nThe operators of the Tianjin site have been accused of \"clearly violating\" safety rules.\\nChina has ordered a nationwide check on dangerous chemicals and explosives.\\nChina\\'s cabinet also ordered officials to \"crack down unwaveringly on illegal activities to ensure safety\".\\nTwenty-five of the injured are in critical condition and 33 are serious.\\nSome fires are still smouldering and chemical experts are testing for toxic gases.\\nThe cause of the blast is still being investigated.\\nOfficials have only confirmed that calcium carbide, potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate were at the warehouse.\\nBut there were reports in the People\\'s Daily that 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide were at the Tianjin site. Ammonium nitrate may also have been present.\\nChinese officials, though, have admitted there are discrepancies between accounts from the company and from customs, and that damage to company offices had made it hard to identify the chemicals.\\nMore than 200 chemical and biological experts from the military are on site but officials insist that the air and water quality levels in Tianjin are safe.\\nPeople\\'s Daily said the Tianjin facility, operated by Ruihai Logistics, had \"clearly violated\" safety rules that say dangerous materials must be stored at least 1km (0.6 mile) away from public buildings and main roads.\\nState media said the manager of the Ruihai Logistics site had been detained.\\nFire officials have defended the actions of the team who responded to the initial report of a fire on Wednesday night, amid suggestions that using water on some of the chemicals could have led to the blasts.\\nCalcium carbide reacts with water to create the highly explosive acetylene.\\nFire department official Lei Jinde said: \"We knew there was calcium carbide inside but we didn\\'t know whether it had already exploded. At that point no-one knew, it wasn\\'t that the firefighters were stupid.\"\\nThey would not have sprayed water on calcium carbide, he said, although he admitted it was a large warehouse and the team could not be sure where that substance was.\\nChemical experts suggest an acetylene blast could then have detonated ammonium nitrate causing a much larger blast.\\nThere were two explosions. The first was equivalent to about three tons of TNT, the second - some 30 seconds later - was equivalent to 21 tons.\\nWhat we know about explosions: Much of what happened is unclear, but here is what we do know\\nFears after explosions: The questions being asked by Chinese citizens\\n\\'Hero\\' firefighters hailed: Social media praise teams\\nPotent chemical mix behind blasts: What caused the dramatic explosions?\\nBlast \\'like end of the world\\': Residents\\' stories\\nPictures reveal devastation: The latest images from Tianjin\\n\\'Netizens\\' critical of coverage silenced: Authorities remove social media posts', 'The analysis of nearly 20,000 Danish couples found 65% had children within three years and 71% within five years.\\nDoctors, presenting their data at a fertility conference, said the odds were heavily influenced by age.\\nBut experts said the findings were very encouraging for couples struggling to have babies.\\nThere is strong evidence that about one in three cycles of IVF is successful in women under the age of 35.\\nBut what happens in the long run, when some couples try over and over again, others give up and some have problems that cannot be treated, has been uncertain.\\nResearchers at the Copenhagen University Hospital used rigorous registry records in Denmark to follow 19,884 women from the moment they started fertility treatment.\\nThe results, presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, showed that more than half had given birth within two years, rising to 71% after five years.\\nFor women under 35, 80% had children within five years. But the figure fell to 61% in those between 35 and 40 years old; and fell again to 26% in women over 40.\\nDr Sara Malchau, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: \"There is a very good chance of having a child, even if you have difficulties conceiving on your own.\\n\"Most causes of infertility can be overcome, but age is the most important factor to predict if treatments are going to be successful or not.\\n\"Also women with a body mass index under 30 had better outcomes as well as women who didn\\'t smoke.\"\\nThe study also found that nearly a fifth of the women under 35 ended up conceiving as a result of sex - despite having sought fertility treatment.\\nHowever, Dr Malchau cautioned Denmark prioritised fertility treatments that made it easier for women to keep trying. Many other countries are less generous.\\nWomen:\\nMen:\\nSource: HFEA\\nProf Nick Macklon, from the University of Southampton, said: \"It really does provide some encouraging news for those who are about to embark on the journey of fertility treatment - the chance of having a baby is good.\\n\"There will always be individual factors that affect an individual\\'s prognosis, but overall it shows us fertility treatments are working.\\n\"There\\'s been a lot of debate about whether women should be having their children earlier, most of the people in my field would be of the view that if you can start earlier then your chances of completing the family you desire is going to be much higher.\"\\nFollow James on Twitter.']\n",
